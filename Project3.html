                <p> I wrote a research paper on the Great Consle Wars detailing how exactly
                the rivalry between Sega and Nintendo took place, why the fact that Sega and
                Nintendo went to war is important, and what the ramifications of their war
                meant for gaming as a medium. Here is a link to download my paper for anyone
                that is interested in reading it.</p>
