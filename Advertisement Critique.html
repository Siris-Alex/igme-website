        <ul>
            <li>- I wanted to create an advertisement detailing the lemon as the true test of strength in nature. I used Shotcut and edited in some effects to add flair to the video, and used audacity to mix in my voice, which is still kinda hard to hear</li>
            <li>- The critique didn't shape my revisions that much, my group members liked my video</li>
            <li>- Brian - His video was good, but his audio was a little hard to hear
                  John - Great video, only problem was that the cuts were a little jumpy, but otherwise excellent
                  Aron - Not present for critique
                  Cill - No video to critique at the time of critique
